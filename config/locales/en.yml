# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    warning:
      js_prompt: |
        If you delete your browser-memory (or your browser does that itself, when closing) editing your registrations will be very tedious. We strongly recommend that you keep the memory, until the deadline.

        If you understood that type 'I know':

        body_html: |
          You were not redirected because your javascript is not working.

          If you want a comfortable experience editing registrations, you needs
          1. Your Javascript
          2. You can't delete your browser-memory until the deadline.

          We strongly recommend that you do that. Otherwise it will be tedious to edit, but possible. If you want to go on like this confirm your email-adress by klicking %{link}.

      browser_deleted_js_prompt: |
        Your browser doesn't remember the (encrypted) data for this registration.

        If you created the registration from another computer (or browser), consider to return there for changing it. If you update now we delete the browser-memory for this registration, which will make editing more confusing for you.

        To identify a registration without browser-memory, look up the ID in your old emails. You can re-enter the name for getting a better overview

        If you understand the consequences of updating this dataset with this browser, type 'I understand' :
      browser_deleted_js_prompt_answer: "I understand"
      updated_in_other_browser_js_alert: "Last time you used another browser to update this registration, which is where the most accurate memory of it is now.
